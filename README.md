## Description

SisterFlora is an online flower shop designed to bring the beauty of nature into everyday lives. This project was motivated by the desire to create an easy and engaging platform for users to explore, learn about, and purchase flowers.

### What problem does it solve?

Many online flower shops feel impersonal and lack the charm of browsing in person. SisterFlora solves this problem by creating an inviting and informative space where users can not only purchase flowers but also learn about them, understand their significance, and connect with the brand through helpful resources and community-driven content. It bridges the gap between convenience and personal touch, providing a unique and enjoyable experience for flower lovers everywhere.
